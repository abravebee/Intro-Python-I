"""
Python makes performing file I/O simple. Take a look
at how to read and write to files here: 

https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files
"""

# Open up the "foo.txt" file (which already exists) for reading
# Print all the contents of the file, then close the file

# YOUR CODE HERE
with open('foo.txt', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read();
    print(content)
## writing it as print(f.read()) gives me an error about the file already being closed. 
## possibly closes just before print, which is run before f.read() in this case?

# Open up a file called "bar.txt" (which doesn't exist yet) for
# writing. Write three lines of arbitrary content to that file,
# then close the file. Open up "bar.txt" and inspect it to make 
# sure that it contains what you expect it to contain

# YOUR CODE HERE
with open('bar.txt', 'w') as b:
    b.write('\n\nOutside, the wind ceased.\n Owls halted in mid-flight.\n Well, maybe they did, maybe they didnâ€™t, certainly the central heating chose that moment to shut down, unable perhaps to cope with the supernatural chill that suddenly whipped through the room.')

with open('bar.txt', 'r') as b:
    content = b.read();
    print(content)

## How to do the above with r+?
